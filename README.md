# Nodejs
- it is a javascript runtime environment
- Runtime: A program that runs another program
- To run javascript code in local machine we need to install nodejs in our system
- Built on C++
- Built on top of Google Chrome V8 engine(V8 engine is an engine which is used to run javascript code in browser)
- Used for:API,Micro-Services,real-time app,JSON-based API
# Architecture of Nodejs
- Single Threaded(thread-> smallest unit of operation)
- Non-blocking operation-> time consuming code is sent to the worker thread and ohter codes are executed in main thread
- Event-Driven->
